# Try it out
1) Download main.py and requirements.txt 
2) Make sure all packages and dependencies are installed in virtual environemnt by running: `pip install  -r requirements.txt `
3) Run main.py in terminal using the following command, making sure you are in the same working directory as main.py is saved: `python3 main.py`
4) For now, the flask app will be locally hosted, which can be found at [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)


# Future Work
- Include google engine hosting of the webapp
- Add interactive user input queries on the webapp to update MCMC simulation results 
- Enable local figure saving
